            XI. SUSPENSION OF SERVICE
          </h2>
          <p>
            We may suspend the delivery/supply of Services to You. We may have
            to suspend the supply of the Services because: <br /> (a) We have to
            deal with technical problems or make minor technical changes; <br />{" "}
            (b) update the Services to reflect changes in relevant laws and
            regulatory requirements; or <br />
            (b) update the Services to reflect changes in relevant laws and
            regulatory requirements; or <br />
            We will contact you in advance to tell you that we will be
            suspending supply of the Services, unless the problem is urgent or
            an emergency. If we have to suspend the supply of Services for
            longer than one (1) month we will adjust the price so that you do
            not pay for Services while they are suspended. You may contact us to
            end the agreement for the supply of Services if we suspend it, or
            tell you We are going to suspend it, in each case for a period of
            more than one (1) month and We will refund any sums You have paid in
            advance for the Services in respect of the period after You end the
            agreement. If we have provided you with some of the Services then we
            will refund to you an amount proportionate to the balance of the
            remaining Services.
            <br />
            We may also suspend supply of the Services if you do not pay. If you
            do not pay us for the Services when you are supposed to and you
            still do not make payment within two (2) calendar days of Us
            reminding you that payment is due, We may suspend supply of the
            Services until You have paid us the outstanding amounts. We will
            contact you to tell you that we are suspending supply of the
            Services. We will not suspend the Services where you dispute the
            unpaid invoice. We will not charge you for the Services during the
            period for which they are suspended. As well as suspending the
            Services We can also charge you interest on your overdue payments.
            <br />
            We are not responsible for delays outside our control. If our
            delivery of the Services is delayed by an event outside our control
            then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we
            will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do
            this we will not be liable for delays caused by the event, but if
            there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to end the
            Contract and receive a refund for any Services You have paid for but
            not received.
